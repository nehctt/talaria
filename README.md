# Project Talaria

Talaria is a music player that, given a song, returns a playlist of similar songs. The similarity is determined using an AI model that analyzes the audio embeddings of the songsâ€”songs that "sound similar" according to the model will be included in the playlist.

## Setup and Instructions

### 1. MP3 Preparation

   ```bash
   cd src/collect/
   ```

2. **Add MP3 Files:**
   - Place all MP3 files in the `raw_mp3` folder.
   - You can prepare your own MP3 files or download from YouTube using:
     ```bash
     python youtube_scraper.py --playlist_url [url]
     ```

3. **Prepare Song ID and Name Mapping:**
   - Run the following script to assign a unique `song_id` to each song and map it to the song name:
     ```bash
     python create_song_id.py
     ```

4. **Extract Highest Energy 30-Second Segments:**
   - Extract the highest-energy 30-second segment from each song, which will be used for embeddings computation:
     ```bash
     python extract_song_energy.py
     ```

### 2. Search Function

   ```bash
   cd src/search/
   ```

2. **Prepare Embeddings:**
   - Generate embeddings for each song:
     ```bash
     python get_song_emb.py
     ```

3. **Set Up Qdrant for Embedding Search:**
   - Qdrant is used as the vector database to perform similarity searches based on embeddings. Start the Qdrant instance with Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

4. **Store Vectors in Qdrant Collection:**
   - Add the generated embeddings to a Qdrant collection:
     ```bash
     python create_qdrant_data.py
     ```

### 3. Frontend Setup

   ```bash
   cd src/frontend/static/
   ```

2. **Install Howler.js for Audio Playback:**
   - Install `howler.js` via npm:
     ```bash
     npm install howler
     ```

### 4. Backend Setup

   ```bash
   cd src/backend/
   ```

2. **Start the Backend Server:**
   - Run the Flask application to serve the backend:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

---

## Usage

- The frontend provides a search bar where users can enter a song ID or song name. Based on the input, the backend will retrieve and display a playlist of similar songs.
